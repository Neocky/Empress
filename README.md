A simple package manager written as a Windows PowerShell module.

## About
This is a simple package manager written in PowerShell.  
If run, it will download an unattended installation script of the specific program and executes the PowerShell script.  
The PowerShell script will then download and silently install the specific program.   
Packages are named after their folder in which their installation script is.  
All available software packages are in the [SortwarePackages](https://github.com/Neocky/Empress/tree/main/SoftwarePackages) Folder.
